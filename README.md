## Elliptic Curve P-192(ECDSA standard)

I implemented arithmetic on elliptic curves:

 1. functions for checking whether a point belongs to a curve;
 2. adding points;
 3. doubling point;
 4. scalar product;
 5. functions of transformation of a point between affine and projective coordinates.
 6. Tests to check the correctness of operations
