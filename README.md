# ElipticCurves_lab1

I implemented arithmetic on elliptic curves:

 1. functions for checking whether a point belongs to a curve;
 2. adding points;
 3. doubling point;
 4. scalar product;
 5. functions of transformation of a point between affine and projective coordinates.

To check the execution of the program the parameters of the elliptic curve P-192 (ECDSA standard).
